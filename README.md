# README Generator

## Description of Project
Every repository should have a thorough, easy-to-navigate README.  Unfortunately, putting one together takes time.  To save time, this application generates the bulk of the markdown needed for your README and fills in the gaps based on user input!

Once prompted, enter a project description, license information, installation and usage instructions, contact information, and next thing you know - your README is ready to go!

## Takeaways
So far, I have enjoyed learning the fundamentals of back-end programming.  The three primary takeaways from this project are:

- Writing command-line applications with Node.js
- Interacting with the file system using require(fs) as an identifier 
- Using the inquirer package to gather user data through a series of prompts
